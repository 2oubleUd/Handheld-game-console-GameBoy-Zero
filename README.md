# Handheld-game-console-GameBoy-Zero-
This is my graduation project for Electronics Engineering faculty at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.
Console runs on Recalbox OS 4.1.0 what allows you to play in hundreds of games produced for GameBoy, GameBoy Color, NES, SNES and more. 
Whole project is based on microcomputer Raspberry Pi Zero W. Microcomputer is supported by several electronics circuts: battery power circuit (including charging and battery protection), bandpass RC filter, audio amplifier, game control circuit and LCD screen.
